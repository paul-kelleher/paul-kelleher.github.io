I am Professor of Bioethics and Philosophy at the University of Wisconsin--Madison.

My research and teaching explore ethical and other philosophical dimensions of public policy, especially climate policy and health policy.

My book *The Social Cost of Carbon: Ethics and the Limits of Climate Change Economics* was recently published in Oxford University Press's PPE Book Series. [Click here](https://www.paulkelleher.net/sccbook/) for more details.
