I am an Associate Professor of Bioethics and Philosophy at the University of Wisconsin--Madison.

My teaching and research explore ethical and philosophical dimensions of public policy, especially climate policy and health policy.

My book *The Social Cost of Carbon: Ethics and the Limits of Climate Change Economics* is forthcoming in Oxford University Press's [PPE Book Series](https://ppebookseries.org/).

*I am currently in the process of migrating this site from Wordpress to a Quarto website hosted by Github. More to come.*
