I am an Associate Professor of Bioethics and Philosophy at the University of Wisconsin--Madison.

My teaching and research explore ethical and other philosophical dimensions of public policy, especially climate policy and health policy.

My book *The Social Cost of Carbon: Ethics and the Limits of Climate Change Economics* is forthcoming in Oxford University Press's [PPE Book Series](https://ppebookseries.org/).
