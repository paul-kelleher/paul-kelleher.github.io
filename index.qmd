I am an Associate Professor of Bioethics and Philosophy at the University of Wisconsin--Madison.

My teaching and research explore ethical and philosophical dimensions of public policy, especially climate policy and health policy.

My main current research project is a book-in-progress on climate change economics. The book is under contract with Oxford University Press's [PPE Book Series](https://ppebookseries.org/).

I am currently in the process of migrating this site from Wordpress to Github. More to come.
